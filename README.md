# myInitial-Bookshelf

It is with great pleasure that I present to you my initial project hosted on GitHub, focused on building a back-end application specifically tailored for beginners. This project aims to provide an accessible learning platform for individuals who are just starting their journey into back-end development.

I am excited to share with you the progress I have made on in this project, hosted on GitHub and deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance. It has been a challenging yet rewarding journey thus far, as I have successfully tackled various aspects of our development process. However, I must address the presence of ongoing errors that I am currently facing on our EC2 instance.

As written in the module of DICODING that I shall provide debit card to register in AWS to get free tier access but unfortunately my BRI debit card is not accepted as payment method to get this free tier. I am so sorry for this and I do not have enough money to open new account in other bank or making account in Dollar so this excitment are not followed the good result to my first project.

This is what I get from AWS : We were unable to verify your default payment method. To avoid payment failures, and potential disruption in using AWS services, please contact your bank to determine the reason and visit this page to verify your payment method. You can also choose to add another card. If the issue persists, contact AWS
